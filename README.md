# TrackCovid19
An app that helps you to track the progress of COVID-19. 

Please feel free to modify this app to fit your own purposes and if needed submit an issue which will be fixed ASAP.

# Editing the app on your own

Download Android Studio or any other similar code editor and run the app on your own in order to edit the files inside.

The code is not the most well-written, but will provide you with a sense of understanding as to how it works, as the code itself is not very complicated

# Downloading the app on your own

In order to download the app on your own, you will need to navigate to another repository to [which I will link to here](https://github.com/souravp712/TrackCovid19APK) .~~, or you can wait for the approval of the app to the Google Play Store.~~
