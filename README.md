# TrackCovid19
An app that helps you to track the progress of COVID-19. 

Please feel free to modify this app to fit your own purposes and if needed submit an issue which will be fixed ASAP.

# Editing the app on your own

In a terminal on MacOS or Linux, run git clone https://github.com/souravp712/TrackCovid19 if you have git installed and then open the folder in Android Studio, or go to this link for an easier download process.

Download Android Studio or any other similar code editor and run the app on your own in order to edit the files inside.

The code is not the most well-written, but will provide you with a sense of understanding as to how it works, as the code itself is not very complicated

# Downloading the app onto your own (Android)phone

In order to download the app on your own, you will need to navigate to my release page, [which I will link here](https://github.com/souravp712/TrackCovid19/releases/tag/v1.0) ~~, or you can wait for the approval of the app to the Google Play Store.~~

Then click on TrackCovid19APK, and it will then be installed onto your phone. You may need to accept some permissions in order for the app to be installed. Then click install, and the app will be installed onto your own Android device
