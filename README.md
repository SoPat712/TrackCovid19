# TrackCovid19
An app that helps you to track the progress of COVID-19 around the world.

If it is needed, feel free to submit an issue on this Github page, and the issue will be fixed ASAP.

# Downloading the app onto your own (Android) phone

In order to download the app on your own, you will need to navigate to my release apk download page, [which I will link here](https://github.com/SoPat712/TrackCovid19/releases/download/v1.4/TrackCovid19.apk), or you can wait for the approval of the app to the Google Play Store.

You may need to accept some permissions in order for the app to be installed. Then click install, and the app will be installed onto your own Android device for your own usages.

# Editing the app on your own

In a terminal on MacOS or Linux, run ```git clone https://github.com/SoPat712/TrackCovid19``` if you have git installed and then open the folder in Android Studio or another similar code editor, or [go to this link for an easier download process on any OS.](https://github.com/SoPat712/TrackCovid19/archive/master.zip)

Download Android Studio or any other similar code editor and open the project on your own in order to edit the files inside.

The code is not the most well-written, but will provide you with a sense of understanding as to how it works, as the code itself is not very complicated.
