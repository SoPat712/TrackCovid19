# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Version 1 will not collect any data from the user, and merely requires read and write permission from a phone to store data on the phone for offline COVID tracking. Your data will not be updated, but you will see data from a previous time at which the data was updated. As a rule, our app will not check for data in the background, so please open the app in order to have the data for that day loaded in.
